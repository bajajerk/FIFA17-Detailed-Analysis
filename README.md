This repository is made to extend the work on this dataset.
Few Observations to know from analysis:
* Linear Regression found to be a good model to predict Rating with score of 0.84

**Eden Hazard** Chart's as can be seen, is comparable with **Cristiano Ronaldo**. Yayyyy! No wonder why Zinedine Zidane want Hazard to join Real Madrid!

This repository is made to extend the work on this dataset.
Few Observations to know from analysis:
* Linear Regression found to be a good model to predict Rating with score of 0.84
* As you can see below, **Messi's** Chart is almost inscribed inside other two's charts. Sorry Messi Fans.
**Eden Hazard** Chart's as can be seen, is comparable with **Cristiano Ronaldo**. Yayyyy! No wonder why Zinedine Zidane want Hazard to join Real Madrid!
